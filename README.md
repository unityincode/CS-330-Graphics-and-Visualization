1.How do I approach designing software?
I start by understanding the project requirements and breaking down the design into manageable parts. For the 3D scene, I focused on using basic shapes, point lighting, and camera controls to meet the projectâ€™s goals.
New design skills gained included modularizing code and efficiently using low-polygon models while maintaining visual quality.
These skills can be applied to future projects by helping me create well-organized codebases and optimizing resource usage for better performance.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
I used incremental strategies, building the 3D scene step by step, starting with basic shapes, then adding textures, lighting, and controls.
Iteration was key; I tested the scene regularly, refining lighting and camera sensitivity to improve the user experience.
My approach evolved by focusing more on modular functions, which simplified debugging and adjustments.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualizations have taught me how to create interactive environments, which is essential for game development and simulations.
These skills also enhance problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, which are valuable for software engineering and technical problem-solving in my career pathway.
